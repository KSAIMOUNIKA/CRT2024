The company Digital Secure Data Transfer Solutions provides data encryption and data sharing services. Their process uses a key K for encryption when transmitting characters. To encrypt a character, the character is replaced by the following Kth character with the same case in the English alphabet set. The English alphabetical set is considered in a cyclic fashion for the last K characters. Write an algorithm to find the character used to encrypt the given character.

Input Format

The input consists of a space-separated character and integer – character and key, representing the character to be transmitted, and the key (K), respectively.

Constraints

NA

Output Format

Print a character representing the encrypted character.

Sample Input 0
